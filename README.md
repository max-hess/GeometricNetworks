# GeometricNetworks
Tree segmentation of LiDAR point clouds with geometric networks

The geometric_networks.py file conatins the script for segmenting trees in LAS files. 

The example file executes the geometric network script for a test file (test_file_simple.las).

The segmented point cloud will be saved as a LAS file with the given tree labels stored as the point source id.
